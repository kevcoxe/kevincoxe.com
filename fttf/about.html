        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
        There have been reports of a zombie outbreak at a warehouse by the
        docks. You are Edward Bennigan, a member of a paramilitary organization
        that combats these foul creatures in order to protect mankind. You are
        part of a four-man team of weapon specialists: Rocket Specialist
        William Wilhelm, Sniper Specialist Sheila Van Dahm, Machine Gun
        Specialist Rodney Banks and you, Handgun Specialist Edward Bennigan.
        Your four-man team was sent in to investigate the situation, secure the
        area, and eliminate the zombies. Unfortunately, your team was attacked
        by a large zombie horde upon arrival and you have been separated from
        your teammates. Your goal now is to survive, find your teammates, and
        find the source of this zombie outbreak and stop it if you can.
        </p>

        <h3>The Basement</h3>

        <p>
        You fight your way through the basement with your trusty pistol and
        manage to reach the stairs. As you ascend to the next level you
        discover Machine Gun Specialist Bank's minigun in the stairwell. There
        is no sign of Bank's except for the blood smearing the walls which
        could just as well belong to the zombie corpses that litter the stairs.
        You continue upwards, minigun in tow.
        </p>

        <h3>The Loading Bay</h3>

        <p>
        You make it onto the loading bay. If you can just get through the
        loading bay doors you'll be home free. You use Bank's minigun to mow
        down the zombies in your path and reach the large metal doors. Just as
        you're about to pull the lever to open the door something catches your
        eye. Sniper Specialist Van Dahm's rifle lying next to a door that is
        slightly ajar. You look through the door and discover a staircase
        descending into darkness. Should you follow this path in the hopes of
        finding your teammates alive? Or leave through the loading bay doors
        before more zombies show up?
        </p>

        <h3>The Sub-Basement</h3>

        <p>
        Descending the staircase you find another level, lower than the
        basement. Large glass tanks filled with an eerie blue liquid line the
        walls. They provide the only illumination in this dark room. There is a
        door at the other end of the room and you make your way towards it. The
        zombies down here are larger and more powerful than the ones in the
        loading bay but with Van Dahm's sniper rifle and Bank's minigun you
        make short work of them. Soon you reach the door. Next to it, lying on
        the ground like discarded trash, is Rocket Specialist Wilhelm's prized
        rocket launcher. You pick up the discarded weapon and continue through
        the door, fearing the worst.
        </p>

        <h3>The Birthing Chamber</h3>

        <p>
        You find yourself on a balcony overlooking a large room. You think your
        eyes are playing tricks on you because in the darkness it looks like
        the floor below you is tossing and turning like a restless sea but then
        you realize it's just packed from wall to wall with zombies. The horde
        quickly takes notice of you and begins charging up the stairs. You make
        good use of Wilhelm's rocket launcher and blow the foul creatures to
        oblivion with shell after shell.
        </p>

        <p>
        Soon there are no more of the creatures left. You make your way down to
        the floor, looking for a light switch. The bodies of your teammates
        were almost certainly among the ones you blew to pieces just now. Or
        perhaps you bore them through with a high-powered rifle shot to the
        brain in the previous room or ripped them to shreds with the minigun
        back in the loading bay or maybe you murdered them all the way back in
        the basement with your very own pistol.
        </p>

        <p>
        You finally find a light switch so you can survey the massacre
        properly. The floor is covered with the shredded and bloody bodies of
        the zombies. Along the walls you can see more of the eerie blue tanks
        from before but these ones aren't empty. Each one holds a human-like
        lifeform in various stages of growth, from fetuses to adults. Your mind
        flashes back to whispered rumors of secret military cloning projects
        that were supposedly shutdown years ago, around the same time as the
        zombie outbreaks started.
        </p>

        <p>
        But what holds your attention is the grotesque figure in the center of
        the room. What you see is hard to describe. It looks as if several
        zombies where thrown into a trash compactor that conked out halfway
        through crushing them entirely. Arms, legs and faces dot the surface of
        the creatures oozing, green body. The large misshapen blob of green
        slime and rotting flesh quivers and shakes every now and again and odd
        groaning noises erupt from somewhere deep inside its body. You see
        dozens of metal tubes protruding from the creature. They run along the
        floor, connecting it to the tanks along the walls. Every now and again
        the blob will shiver and make a squelching sound and one of the tanks
        will fill with a foul looking cloud of green liquid.
        </p>

        <p>
        This is the source of the zombie outbreak, you realize. This is why no
        matter how many you’ve killed over the years always more pop up. The
        zombies discovered what the military tried to cover up so long ago: a
        cloning machine. They creating artificial humans and infecting them as
        they mature to create an endless supply of zombies and this horrendous
        creature before you is the source of the virus. But this revelation is
        not what horrifies you the most. From the putrid flesh of the super
        zombie, among all the horrific visages, three familiar ones stare out
        at you. It seems you have not yet given your teammates the rest they
        deserve.  The Final Battle:
        </p>

        <p>
        With this terrible revelation before your eyes and horrified vengeance
        in your heart you set out to destroy The Source. This is no easy task
        as it uses your former teammates against you. It seems that The Source
        not only amasses bodies into its being but also weapons. From its
        bowels the creature produces a handheld machine gun, a sniper rifle,
        and a rocket launcher and the dead hands of your comrades grasp them
        with practiced ease. You run around the room, making it hard for the
        slow creature to aim at you but you soon find it hard to stay near the
        edges of the room as The Source sends new zombies at you from the
        birthing tanks. Utilizing all of your comrades’ weapons you keep the
        zombies at by while also tearing into The Source with all the
        ammunition you have until the creature finally succumbs to its wounds
        and dies in an explosion of green slime.
