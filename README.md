#Bitd00d

Bitd00d is a unique 2d platformer. At first it looks like a simple game, but the 
mechanics behind the scenes are impressive. We used javascript and the Quintus 
game engine to create the front end look and feel of the game. The interesting 
part is when you look at the back end. Using PHP we retrieve the html code that 
is passed in by url, and then we generate a level based off of tags in the code. 
Another fun feature is that if the webpage passed in had any external links to 
other pages the game will generate a door that the player can enter taking them 
to a whole new level. This allows players to theoretically traverse the internet 
in game form.
